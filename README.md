# Current2020

This is a wrangler app that opens up the saved sales figures, edits ones of them and then saves it a new csv file.

Message: There is yet more work to be done. The following is what pending:

a. Clear all empty rows
b. Reset the order ID
c. Divide the purchase address column into 3 separate columns.


This is something I did as a practice run for my university in October 2020 and I barely found the original code.
Thus, I had to refine.

More to be updated soon.
